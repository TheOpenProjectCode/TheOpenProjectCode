# Welcome to The Open Project
### The Open Project is a project that creates and encourages the world to become open source.

### Here's what we're working on at the moment:
   * OpenScript - a free, open-source programming language designed for everyone
   * OpenOS - an open-source operating system with a lot of customisability, security and easy-to-use gui
   * Lots more!
   

We'd really appreciate it if you could contribute or simply use The Open Project!
If you have any queries, please email me <a href="mailto:TheOpenProjectCode@gmail.com">here</a> or leave a message on this profile!
We hope you enjoy using The Open Project!
